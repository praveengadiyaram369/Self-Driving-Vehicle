# Self-Driving-Vehicle
The interface of the autonomous car with the surroundings must be similar to that of human way of interaction. Humans use their eyes as a source of vision and then processes the visual signals in his/her brain and takes the necessary action accordingly. Similarly the autonomous car uses a camera as a visual source to know its surrounding, path etc. and uses the image processing techniques on the images received from the camera. This processing takes place on a minicomputer (RASPBERRY PI). After image processing, control instructions are passed on to the driving motors which helps in steering the vehicle accordingly.
